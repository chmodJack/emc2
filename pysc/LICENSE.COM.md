Dual Licensing Scheme {#license_com}
=====================

PySC/USI is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
Version 3 and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated
directly with TU-Braunschweig, c3e. If you obtained SoCRocket under
the LGPL, then the LGPL applies to the PySc/USI repositories
used on your system as well, except as defined below. The LGPL (version 3)
is included in this source tree in the file @ref license_lgpl "LICENSE.LGPL.md".

Other repositories might include various components that are not part of
SoCRocket or PySc/USI itself; these components might not be distributed
under AGPL. If the repository state an own license it is distributed by
the stated terms.

TU-Braunschweig, c3e holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the PySc/USI repositories, and therefore can grant,
at its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or
organizations to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not LGPL)
repositories which may be linked with the portions of SoCRocket which
fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under
more flexible licenses than LGPL.

If you wish to use our code in other (L)GPL programs, don't worry --
there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
(L)GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for PySc/USI we
would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).
